We welcome contributions to the SSH-Sync Server project! Whether you're looking to fix bugs, add new features, or improve documentation, your help is appreciated. Here's how you can contribute:

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion for improving SSH-Sync Server, please first check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/therealpaulgg/ssh-sync-server/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, feel free to open a new issue. Please provide as much detail as possible to help us understand the problem or enhancement.

## Submitting Pull Requests

We accept contributions through pull requests. Here are the steps to submit your contributions:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes.
4. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards.
5. Submit a pull request against the main branch.

Please provide a clear description of the problem and solution, including any relevant issue numbers.

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to our Code of Conduct. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## AI Use

The use of LLM-generated code is allowed in this project. Some basic guidelines to follow:
- AI generated code should meet or exceed the quality of human code. **No slop.**
- Due to the nature of this project heavily using cryptography, it is imperative that LLM generated code is carefully reviewed by a human. AI-assisted reviews can be helpful but human review is mandatory. The code in a pull request is the responsibility of the author and approvers, not the LLM.
- Human testing and verification is still crucial. This project does not have enough unit/integration/E2E tests (yet) to have fully automated testing for new features. The docker environment setup helps with this.
- **Humans should have a full understanding of the code being submitted in a PR.** This cannot be overstated enough. It is particularly important for open source projects, where time is limited, and contributions are frequent.
- We don't require a disclosure that AI was used in code generation. You may choose to disclose that if you wish. Transparency is encouraged.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about contributing, please feel free to ask in the issue tracker or reach out to the maintainers.
